# Fylo Data Storage Component

This is a mini-project from the Frontend Mentor challenges, where I built the Fylo data storage component using HTML and Tailwind CSS.

The Fylo data storage component is a simple and elegant design for displaying storage statistics for a cloud storage service. 

## Demo

You can view a live demo of this project on [here](https://fylodatastoragecomponent.pages.dev/).

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/thekarthikr/FyloDataStorageComponent.git


Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

Run Tailwind CLI in watch mode

```
npm run dev
```

You can use tailwind classes in any .html files in the root directory

Put any custom CSS that you may have in the **src/input.css** file

Add any config values to the **tailwind.config.js** file

2. Open the project in your code editor.

3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the project.

To build once, run

```
npm run build
```
You only need to deploy your html files and css/style.css


## Credits

This project is based on the [Fylo data storage component](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/fylo-data-storage-component-1dZPRbV5n) challenge from Frontend Mentor.

The design and assets were provided by Frontend Mentor. I built the project using HTML and Tailwind CSS, with some minor modifications to the original design to make it responsive and accessible.
